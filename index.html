        <p class="strong-red">ittering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags,
            incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.
            We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of

            The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see
            with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the
            web.</p>
